<h2 id="tuesday-6-april">Tuesday 6 April</h2>
<p>The focus of this week was privacy and surveillance. The leading group
opened with this quote from article 6 of the United States
Constitution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
seized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This excerpt was presented to the class in order to generate
discussion on how the Bill of Rights applies to privacy in the modern,
technological world. Because privacy is valued in the United States,
we were also asked to consider if Americans’ are currently being
violated by technology.</p>
<p>Groups discussed reasonable amounts of privacy, consent given through
terms of service, what constitutes private property, and the
government’s role in technological regulation. One point that was
brought up by a student in a small group discussion was that big
companies' use of users’ data without consent is counter to our
societal beliefs.</p>
<p>Another student brought up that many of the laws in the constitution
are outdated and do not apply to private companies. Privacy, as
defined in the Constitution, does not encompass user data because it
is referring explicitly to physical property. It also does not limit
what companies can do — it only constrains what the government
can do. This made sense during the founders' era when no company had
amassed the kind of powers companies have today, but in some ways
companies have become more powerful than governments.</p>
<p>New laws and regulations outside of the constitution need to be
instituted because the Constitution can not protect citizens from big
tech companies. Therefore, in several of the groups, the discussion
shifted to the question of whether or not one’s data should be
implicitly owed by the user themselves. While several good points were
made on both sides, the consensus was that this was not a simple black
and white issue, but instead a very complex one that possesses wide
ranging consequences on society regardless of the choice that is made.</p>
<p>After discussing how the official document defining rights for
Americans (the Constitution) relates to technological rights, we moved
on to discussing the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of
Ethics. Check out more information on this here (one of our optional
readings). These ethics guide ethical conduct for students,
instructors, and professionals alike, as well as outline privacy in
great detail in section 1.6. The leading team presented us with the
following discussion question: <em>Do you feel as though companies adhere
to the privacy standard described in 1.6 of the Ethics code. Why or
why not? Examples?</em></p>
<p>Class members shared that there is a focus on the companies that do
not adhere to these standards, but that there does exist companies
that adhere to these privacy standards. Companies also will use data
privacy as a marketing tool. Another discussion question posed was <em>in
what ways should tech companies be held accountable for privacy
violations?</em> Class members suggested increased lawsuits and attention
on privacy violations, as well as technology leaders taking a vested
interest in protecting the rights of their users. Another suggestion
was that the ACM should begin issuing certification “badges” to
companies that demonstrate high commitment to users’ data
privacy. Similar to how there is recognition of highly sustainable
business practices, this strategy would put increased social pressures
on businesses to prioritize data protection.</p>
<p>In addition to learning about the ACM&rsquo;s ethics code, we were also
presented with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The key
takeaways from this are as follows: technology enables data collection
with ease for companies, professionals should use personal information
for legitimate reasons without violating others rights, companies
should take necessary steps to ensure data privacy, companies should
also be transparent about data collection and usage.</p>
<p>We ended Tuesday&rsquo;s class with a discussion about our experiences with
surveillance in the United States. We went over the recent history of
the NSA. In the past 20 years, the United States government has spent
million and millions of dollars collecting data about its
citizens. The results have been surprisingly ineffective. The program
has only produced results that would not have already been achieved by
FBI investigations a couple of times.  In discussion, classmates
admitted that they often change their behavior online because they
feel as though the government is watching. We believed that a
surveillance program stifles democracy because citizens are afraid of
speaking their beliefs that are not considered mainstream politics. We
also acknowledged that there is a difficult balance between complete
anonymity and holding people accountable for their actions
online. People shouldn’t feel as though they can say anything online,
even if they don’t believe it, because that causes harmful ideas to
spread unchecked. We also agree that government surveillance shouldn’t
stifle ideas as well.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-6-april">Thursday 6 April</h2>
<p>Thursday’s class continued conversations about privacy and
surveillance via facial recognition with case studies involving local
police and China’s surveillance system. The week was concluded with
understanding HTTP history and exploring our personal cookie usages.</p>
<p>The topic that instigated our discussion about facial recognition
began with Clearview AI, a controversial facial recognition algorithm
that is marketed to help police solve cases. The leading group
emphasized that “your face is not your own” in the context of this AI
system since it does a “reverse google image search” of billions of
photos across the internet. Clearview AI’s photo database is
constructed by scouring the Internet for photos.</p>
<p>There were two uses in local Virginia by police departments in Norfolk
and Virginia Beach that helped solve cases, but it was unbeknownst to
superiors that subordinates were using Clearview AI. Small group
discussions delved into exploring whether we should have claim to our
personal data that is publicly online and be compensated
accordingly. One discussion group member brought up the fact that the
idea of compensation for personal data is not so far-fetched, as
compensation is already offered in the context of research studies at
UVa (ie. vaccine studies, etc.). Other members of the class noted that
distributing compensation for personal data becomes a logistical
nightmare and small amounts of data are almost completely
worthless. In terms of logistics, this discussion also raised a point
that some people may expect compensation to apply retroactively, which
is even more complicated. Finally, it was noted that personal data is
protected under copyright laws; putting your image online does not
make it public domain.</p>
<p>The leading group also brought up a Virginia state bill that was unanimously passed that police may not use facial recognition until further laws were passed and the technology was debated about. Discussion revolved	around debating whether or not Local, State, or Federal police	should be allowed to use such technology and whether the good of the technology outweighs the bad. This discussion offered much discourse. There were definitely concerns about &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;, but these were countered with concerns of how a more connected/globalized society may require a scaled up law enforcement system. It was generally agreed that the government should be prohibited from using this technology for an unfair or unjust purpose. There was also some general consensus that the decision to prohibit police departments from blindly adopting a technology without exploring it first was a good decision. Finally, some discussion revolved around an idea that use of a facial recognition system should require a warrant (as this is the precedent with cell phone data).</p>
<p>Group members raised concerns that in a facial recognition system, it may be harder to only expose the data of one individual, since the system relies on the collection of mass data.  Having discussed local usage of surveillance, our conversation turned towards China and the Panopticon that has been created via a nation-wide surveillance system that uses DNA sequencing, location tracking, gait analysis, etc. Due to the podcast we listened to for this week, we had a discussion of Kenneth Kidd, a Yale researcher who had collaborated on DNA	sequencing research with researchers in China. We discussed whether he should be found guilty or not for his contribution to the current surveillance system, and although there was no intentional contribution to the system, there was to some degree responsibility in sharing knowledge or utilizing DNA sequences from China that may have been collected unethically. A point that was brought up was that China took small pieces of research and combined them into one big system. Therefore, it’s difficult for anyone that contributed to the smaller pieces to foresee that it would be utilized in the big surveillance system.</p>
<p>Another discussion we had was whether or not there are other examples
of technologies that sound benign but could be used nefariously, vice
versa. An important point that was made was how GPS was originally
developed by the military but became ubiquitous in everyone’s lives,
an example of a nefarious technology used benignly. Therefore, it’s
possible that facial recognition could have a benign use in the
future, but currently, it’s cons may outweigh the pros of its use.</p>
<p>Our last topic of discussion for the week was about web services,
learning the basics of what it is and specifically focusing on
cookies: what are they, how are they utilized, and what types of
cookies exist. We continued into an activity of learning about our own
cookie usage by exploring our browsers cookies usage via Storage look
up through browser inspection.</p>
