<p><strong>Team 2</strong></p>
<h3 id="2-march">2 March</h3>
<p>We started off by filling out a survey that asked us about deep
fakes. These questions included: Based on the readings/videos, do you
think that the benefits of deep fake technology can outweigh the
harms? Do you think that deep fakes are really the problem, or is the
real issue the vulnerabilities found in our institutions
(i.e. education, media, election systems)? After looking at the
readings/videos, how confident do you feel in your ability to identify
deep fakes (on a scale of 1-5)? What did you find most interesting in
the readings/videos?</p>
<p>Our results indicated the following about our class’s opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of us think deep fakes can cause more harm than benefits</li>
<li>About half the class thinks the problems that come from deep fakes come from the regulations that we’re lacking in our institutions. A quarter of our class thinks actual deep fake technology is the problem. The rest of the class thinks it is a mixture of both.</li>
<li>Most of us are not confident in our ability to identify deep fakes (most of us chose 2 on a scale of 1-5).</li>
</ul>
<p>To see a real example of deep fake technology being used, we watched
Jordan Peele’s Barack Obama PSA video. Then, the presenter went over a
brief summary of what deep fakes are and how they work. This group
defined deep fakes as “fake media that has been edited using an
algorithm to replace the person in the original video or image with
someone else in a way that makes the post look authentic.” Deep fakes
are made using generative adversarial networks. The presenter notes
that deep fakes are not something that new, they are just a branch of
photo manipulation using more advanced techniques (ML/AI techniques).</p>
<center><img src="/images/df1.png" width=80%></center>
<p>We played a game in which we were shown pictures of people and we had
to identify which photo was real and which was fake. This example
exemplified the difficulty in identifying fake photos, as there was
never full consensus about which was the fake. When discussing these
photos as a class, most people were divided and seemed to justify
their choices with observing small details.</p>
<center><img src="/images/df2.png" width=80%></center>
<p>The main points in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/poSd2CyDpyA"><em>Creating, Weaponizing, and Detecting
Deep Fakes</em></a> consisted of how deep
fakes are generated, types of deep fakes, and weaponizing deep
fakes. The video also went over behavioral mannerisms to detect deep
fakes. They use an example of how former President Obama tilts his
head and frowns at the same time. In the video, he calls out social
media platforms in their role in deep fake technology. In their
algorithm for tracking and detecting deep fakes, they found people are
consistent and distinct from each other, there is a bounding surface
for every grouping of authentic videos, and there is high accuracy for
classifying real and fake photos, but it is not 100% correct all the
time.</p>
<p>In our small groups, we discussed the following questions: 1) Discuss
with your groups and clarify your understanding of the technical
aspects of deep fakes and 2) If you were developing software to
generate deep fakes, how would you break deep fake detectors? This led
to a more detailed explanation of how deep fake technology works, and
the process taken in order to produce deep fake media. Suggestions for
breaking deep fake technology included adding inputs to the doctored
videos that would cause deep fake detectors to fail, leading to false
negatives being able to pass the detectors.</p>
<p>Next, we reviewed the article from Tech Times, <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/246694/20191230/deepfake-examples-that-prove-how-scary-and-amusing-this-technology-is.htm"><em>Deepfake examples
that prove how scary and amusing this technology
is</em></a>. The
article pointed to multiple examples of deep fake technology being
used maliciously against public figures, including Donald Trump,
Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Mark Zuckerberg. Greater detail was
given for the deep fake video of Zuckerberg, where he “exposes''
Facebook&rsquo;s actual intent, referencing the Spectre program used to
collect data on its users and how they utilize it to “own” their
users. The presenter noted the dangers of each example, and how these
videos can alter the public’s perception of an individual.</p>
<p>In our small groups, we discussed the following questions: 1) What
interventions and regulations should be put in place for this
technology? and 2) With the knowledge that deep fake detectors could
backfire if put into the wrong hands, who do you think should be
allowed to have access to deep fake detectors? Responses included the
balance of restricting misinformation while allowing
expression. Another point brought up was if there is a way to verify
or flag if the video is from the original source or if it is
altered. A last point to keep in mind when thinking about regulating
deep fakes is how to discern if a photo or video being edited is
simply aesthetic or harmless purposes and if the photo or video can
pose harmful consequences.</p>
<p>For our homework, we were assigned to read pages 32-37 of Deepfakes
and the Weaponization of Disinformation by Nina Brown. We also had to
find an example of a deep fake that is of good/neutral value. An
example they showed us was <a href="https://twitter.com/damianburns/status/1365247515898097667?s=21">the tweet about the deep fakes of Tom
Cruise</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/csethics/csethics.github.io/discussions/21">Week 5
Activity</a>
post comments for more examples.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-4-march">Thursday 4 March</h2>
<p>We started Thursday’s class with a funny video on deep fakes. The
video featured members of the UVA computer science staff singing along
to Big Time Rush. This was a cun video that showed the creative side
of deep fakes. It served as a good introduction to the theme and
dilemma of Thursday’s class&ndash; do the benefits of deep fakes outweigh
the negative impacts and if not, how do we handle them moving forward?</p>
<p>After watching the video, we had a discussion about the assigned
homework and shared various sites relevant to deep fakes. We found
that general responses were examples concerning the film industry and
nostalgia. One in particular was a website that traces your lineage,
discovers photos of old family members, and animates them using deep
fake technology: <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/family-tree?genealogy=1">https://www.myheritage.com/family-tree?genealogy=1</a>.</p>
<p>Team 5 then summarized the reading for the <a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/ethics-and-technology/viewpoints/deepfakes-and-the-value-neutrality-thesis.html">Colander and Quinn article
on Value-Neutrality</a>. Essentially,
the authors conveyed that technology is neutral until they are used
for either positive or negative purposes. This is what gives
technology a positive or negative label. Nevertheless, this argument
can be misused to dissolve the responsibility of developers for what
they create. Deep fakes are an example of a technology that has great
potential for bad purposes, and the authors argue that their potential
harms must be outweighed by their potential benefits in order for deep
fakes to be value-neutral.</p>
<p>Following this summary, the class discussed the following questions:
(1) Do you agree or disagree with Colaner and Quinn that deep fakes
are not value neutral? (2) Can you think of potential benefits that
could outweigh the negatives they listed in the article?</p>
<p>We then proceeded to cover the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/danielle_citron_how_deepfakes_undermine_truth_and_threaten_democracy">TedTalk
video</a>
by UVA Law Professor Danielle Citron. As a professor who teaches and
writes about information privacy, free expression, and civil rights,
she discusses the issues of deep fakes and the powerlessness of the
legal system to help victims of deep fakes, like Indian journalist
Rana Ayyub. She, like other famous, popular, and prominent figures in
media, entertainment, and other areas was a target of non-consensual
deep fake pornography.</p>
<p>It was noted that people use deep fake technology to escape their
accountability, a concept called “The Liar’s Dividend” and one used to
discredit individuals like Ayyub. This was a traumatic experience for
Ayyub, but like Citron mentions, there is not much that the legal
system could do to help her. They simply tell victims to turn their
computers off and ignore the issue. Hence, Ayyub is a strong believer
in legislation to ban harmful digital impersonations that are as bad
as identity theft and that people must be educated on deep fakes. In
addition, she also believes that social Media should change and
enforce updated terms of service.</p>
<p>With a lack of legal support, it is important that attorneys and legal
academics spend time understanding and evaluating how deep fakes might
be handled moving forward. In the optional Nina Brown reading, she
discusses the issue that combative tech can’t catch up to rapid
development; however, she agrees that new legislation is necessary to
address harm from deep fakes. She mentions that researchers are
pushing to develop detection algorithms and digital forensics and that
education and promoting media literacy, addressing threats are
necessary in this fight for technological freedom vs. constitutional
rights.</p>
<p>In small groups, the class proceeded to discuss 3 discussion
questions: (1) Who benefits from photo/video manipulation technology?
Who is harmed? Why? (1.a.) Companies like the film industry can
benefit, especially if there was a death on set. Deep fake technology
might help when finishing any scenes that a deceased person was
supposed to be in. (2) How should we prevent deep fakes from causing
harm to society and marginalized groups? Discuss different approaches
from the perspective of technology, education, legislation, etc. (2)
What (if any) actions should online platforms (Reddit, Twitter,
YouTube, etc.) be taking to combat the spread of deep fakes on their
sites? (2.a.) What are the ethical implications of choosing to remove
or keep fake video and images on a large social platform?</p>
<p>Some of the responses from this discussion included the dilemmas and
unethical rules with regards to companies. For example, social media
profits off viral content, which becomes an issue when trying to
implement restrictions on content. On a business level, Section 230
gives companies immunity. It states that “No provider or user of an
interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or
speaker of any information provided by another information content
provider.” This becomes an issue when trying to restrict a company’s
content.</p>
<p>Team 5 summarized the final reading, <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3837&amp;context=mlr"><em>The Upside of Deep
Fakes</em></a>. The
argument is that deep fakes can be the final push towards repairing
fundamental institutions in our society. For example, they focus on
media, education, and democratic institutions. To begin, the paper
mentions that social media feeds are perfect for cultivating deep
fakes and that it is important to invest in trusted journalism and
reestablish norms of authentication and verification. Moreover, it is
important to empower advocacy organizations. The authors then proceed
to discuss the role of deep fakes on education and democratic
institutions, highlighting that the fakes should be debunked in
schools and that there need to be greater measures taken to avoid the
sway of deep fakes on elections.</p>
<p>To close, we discussed the following questions: (1) Do you agree with
the Upside of Deep Fakes article? Do deep fakes only accentuate
old/deep problems without creating new ones? (2) Knowing the harm and
upsides of deep fakes, what actions should be taken now? One common
opinion for question 1 was that deep fakes do both. One example was
that they accentuate slander and libel, which are both old
constitutional issues; however, deep fakes provide a lasting, visual
version of libel. Moreover, it is more difficult to track the
producers of harmful deep fakes. Even though it may prove difficult to
enforce, especially on an international level, many classmates believe
that some form of law should be designated for abusing deep fake
technology.</p>
