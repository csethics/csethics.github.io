      <description>Project Ideas Slides for Project Ideas [PDF]
Projects/Papers Students will work on a semester-long project that can take the form of a paper, video, or computing artifact. The project should have some connection to the goals of the class, but these are interpreted broadly. The project can be done individually or in a team, but team projects must have ambition commensurate with the team size. My hope is the students to do projects that will be valuable and worthwhile to them personally as experience, but that will result in something of value beyond just as a course project.</description>

      <description>A new version of the Schedule is now posted!
It includes the planned topics for the weeks, and should be easier to understand than the original schedule.
It worked out for every team to have their top choices as topics, and I think we have a good mix of topics through the semesters. Nothing is set in stone, though, so if your team decides you want to switch your topics (without duplicating something another team is already scheduled to do), let me know and we can change things.</description>

Plan for Week 12: Mock Trial
This week will be a bit different from previous weeks. Most of Tuesday will be a discussion on the readings and topic similar to what we have done previous weeks, but on Thursday, we are going to mix things up a bit and conduct a mock trial!
We are going to split up into teams (we will be splitting the class into teams by the end of class Tuesday) and have teams debate and defend their assigned positions on Thursday.</description>

      <description>A draft syllabus is now posted: Syllabus. This will give more of an idea what is planned for the class, but is incomplete and likely to change before the class starts.
The Discussion forum is now open!
The semester hasn&amp;rsquo;t started, students in this class will be interested in this seminar on Monday at 4pm: Timnit Gebru: Computer Vision - Who is helped and who is harmed? Dr. Gebru has been much in the news recently, and I expect this talk will be relevant to topics we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss in the first few weeks of the class.</description>

      <description>Overview Course Description:
Most decisions today are made by software, most of the rules of society are interpreted and enforced by programs, and much human interaction is now mediated by computing platforms that decide what people see and who they can talk to. As the people who decide what software gets written and how it is deployed, computer scientists have disproportionate power to mold society — for both good and bad.</description>

      <description>This post is preserved for persistence, but I am no longer taking additional students in the class through form submissions.  If you are interested in joining the class, please submit this form:
 https://forms.gle/xZECFhH7DNYHyc6X9  ### (or send me an email on ethical reasons why we shouldn&#39;t ask students to submit information like this using a google form). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the course will be over-subscribed, but if the course fills up, I will be able to add a small number of additional students to the course who I will select based on these responses.</description>
