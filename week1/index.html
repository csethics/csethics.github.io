<p>The main goals for the first week are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set up the cohorts, and have each group get to know each other and
figure out how you will work well together to ensure everyone in
your cohort succeeds in the course and has a good experience
learning with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-awaking the mathematical thinking skills you have (hopefully)
developed previously, and start applying them to problems in theory
of computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing your ability to understand and produce constructive definitions of mathematical concepts, including understanding the connection between sets and the Natural Numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the Principle of Induction and how it enables proofs by induction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>
<p><strong>Before First Meeting</strong> (if possible)<strong>:</strong> <a href="https://forms.gle/pMH4AQJjcrh61JXW8">Course Registration Survey</a></p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, 26 August, 3:30-4:45pm:</strong> Full Class Welcome Meeting — <a href="https://virginia.zoom.us/j/95556147173?pwd=cW5iVUxiSEg4M0pVWlg1MG0yZ29zZz09">Zoom Link</a></p>
<p>This will be the one full class meeting we plan to have during the
semester, and it is at the officially scheduled class time. We hope
everyone can make it to the meeting as scheduled.</p>
<p><font color="red"><b>Wednesday, 26 August, 10:59pm:</b></font> <a href="https://cohortor.herokuapp.com/"><strong>Cohort Scheduling</strong></a></p>
<p>To schedule the cohorts, it is essential that everyone in the course
submits their scheduling preferences by <strong>10:59pm</strong> on
<strong>Wednesday</strong>. We will send out the cohort assignments by Friday
morning, and these will determine your schedule for the rest of the
week (and semester).</p>
<p>Here is the expected schedule for cohorts, based on the day of your
assessed cohort meeting.  This schedule will repeat similarly
throughout the semester.</p>

<h1 id="learning-in-cs3102">Learning in cs3102</h1>
<p>The concepts and techniques we hope you will learn in cs3102 are
different from what you have learned before, and we hope they will
lead you to develop new ways of thinking and approaching problems. It
is not possible for most people to learn this passively; it is
important that you are actively engaged in your learning, and it is a
challenge for most people to do this in a virtual environment. We
believe for most people this also involves a mix of <strong>solitary</strong>
activities, that require internal effort and thought, and <strong>group</strong>
activities, that require discussion and interaction with others.</p>
<p><strong>Problems and Preparation:</strong> The weekly guides will include a set of
problems (<a href="#problems">Cohort Problems</a> below) that will be the focus
on the assessed cohort meeting. We recommend reading through the
problems at the beginning of the week (<a href="/docs/week1problems.pdf">Cohort Problems for Week 1
[PDF]</a>), and starting to think about them
before you do the readings and watch the course videos.  Then, as
you watch the videos and read the book chapters, you should return
to the problems that are related to that material and try to solve
them. For most students, we expect it will be better to mix up
watching and reading with solving the problems, rather than doing
all the preparation materials first before trying the problems.</p>
<p><strong>Advice for watching the course videos:</strong> Most of us are well trained
from thousands of hours of watching mindless television to let our
minds go to mush as soon as a video starts playing. Staying engaged
with videos is much harder than keeping focused in a physical
classroom (which is already quite challenging for most people).</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that we hope will be helpful (if you have other
suggestions, please share them with your classmates in the discord):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Watch together.</strong> If you are able to find others whose schedules&rsquo;
align well enough with yours to watch the course videos as a
group, this is a much better experience and more conducive to
learning and discussion, than watching alone. There are several
apps that allow a group to play youtube videos in sync (e.g.,
<a href="https://sync-tube.de/create">sync-tube.de</a>), so you can watch the
course videos as a group, pausing them to discuss and ask
questions together. You can do this with other students in your
cohort, but it is also fine to do it with other students in the
class who are not in your cohort (or even with people not in the
class).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pause, think, and answer questions.</strong> Most of the videos are
edited recording of lectures we have done in past offerings of
this course. To make the videos watchable, &ldquo;dead time&rdquo; (such as
long pauses waiting for questions and answers) is edited out of
the videos (what was a typical 75 minute class, ends up as about
45 minutes of edited video).  The &ldquo;dead time&rdquo; is time that
students in the live lecture were (hopefully) spending thinking
about what was just presented and the question that may have been
posed. We encourage you to pause the video at points in the
lectures, especially after the lecturer poses a question, to see
if you can answer it yourself before proceeding with the
recording.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take notes.</strong> Writing things down helps understanding. It might
seem silly to take notes when you know you can always replay the
video, but the main value of taking notes is the act of the
note-taking, not the product of the notes. We encourage you to
approach the videos like you would an in person lecture, and take
notes as you watch them, and take advantage of the opportunity to
pause and rewind when helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed-up.</strong> Youtube supposed watching videos at various speeds, up
to 2x the normal speed. For parts of videos where you are
confident in the material already, it is fine to watch at high
speed (1.5x is usually reasonable). It is better to be engaged
with a speeded-up video, than to be bored by a normal-speed one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take Breaks.</strong> Watching videos can be exhausting. Take breaks
often (we include a few reminders and suggestions in the embedded
videos below, but don&rsquo;t limit your breaks to these, and don&rsquo;t feel
obligated to follow our suggestions). Get your eyes of the screen,
and go outside if you can.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="reading">Reading</h1>
<p>The main textbook we will use is <a href="https://introtcs.org/public/index.html"><em>Introduction to Theoretical
Computer Science</em></a> by Boaz
Barak. We will refer to this as the &ldquo;TCS&rdquo; book.</p>
<p>This is an open textbook, you can download the full PDF from
<a href="https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/lnotes_book.pdf"><em>https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/lnotes_book.pdf</em></a>
and contribute to the book by submitting Issues and Pull Requests at
<a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcs"><em>https://github.com/boazbk/tcs</em></a>. (See
the <a href="/syllabus#bonus">Syllabus</a> section on &ldquo;Bonus Points&rdquo; for a bit of
extra motivation for doing this, if just making the world better for
future generations of Theory of Computing students isn&rsquo;t enough
already.)</p>
<p>For Week 1, you should read these two chapters from the TCS book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://introtcs.org/public/lec_01_introduction.html">Chapter 0: Introduction</a> [<a href="https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/lec_01_introduction.pdf">PDF</a>]<br>
<a href="https://introtcs.org/public/lec_00_1_math_background.html">Chapter 1: Mathematical Background</a> [<a href="https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/lec_00_1_math_background.pdf">PDF</a>] (you can skip 1.4.8 and 1.4.9 on <em>Asymptotics and Big-O Notation</em> for now; we will go into more depth on this later in the course)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one additional reading for Week 1 (which you should have already done before submitting the registration survey):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremy Kun, <a href="https://medium.com/@jeremyjkun/habits-of-highly-mathematical-people-b719df12d15e"><em>Habits of highly mathematical people</em></a> (blog post on Medium, July 2016).</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="videos">Videos</h1>
<p>You can play all the week 1 videos using the playlist, but don&rsquo;t forget to take breaks:
